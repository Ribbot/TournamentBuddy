# TournamentBuddy
The Rogue Memorial Challenge is a soccer tournament held annually in Medford, OR. In 2018, over 150 teams from the Pacific Northwest ranging in age from U10 to U19 competed in the tournament.

The [event website](http://events.gotsport.com/events/schedule.aspx?EventID=64302) contains detailed information about teams, match schedules and results, however it is not designed for use on mobile device browsers. Tournament Buddy is a cross-platform application that scrapes data from the website and displays it in an easy to read format on both iOS and Android devices.

# Frameworks/Libraries Used
Tournament Buddy is written in C# using the [Xamarin.Forms](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/) framework. This allows the application to compile for both iOS and Android from a single codebase.

[HTML Agility Pack](https://html-agility-pack.net/) was used to scrape data from the Rogue Memorial Challenge webpage.
